# Real-Time Sermon Translator & Dynamic Scripture Finder

## Project Overview
Develop two interconnected modules for a church management system to enhance the worship experience:

1. **Real-Time Sermon Translator** – Capture, transcribe, and translate live sermons into multiple languages instantly.
2. **Dynamic Scripture Finder** – Detect quoted Bible verses in real time and display full passages with context.

## 1. Real-Time Sermon Translator

### Objective
- Provide on-the-fly transcription and translation of live sermons to break language barriers and support hearing-impaired attendees.

### Process Steps

1. **Audio Capture & Preprocessing**
   - Deploy a lightweight client (mobile or tablet) to record sermon audio in real time.
   - Stream audio chunks via WebSockets to the cloud processing cluster.
   - Apply noise reduction and beam-forming filters at the edge to ensure clear input.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement adaptive noise suppression and test with real chapel acoustics.

2. **Real-Time Transcription**
   - Integrate a low-latency ASR engine (e.g., Whisper or DeepSpeech fine-tuned on sermon recordings).
   - Process audio frames in <500 ms intervals to maintain transcript flow.
   - **Mitigation:** Use GPU-accelerated inference or on-prem edge GPUs to meet <2 s end-to-end latency.

3. **On-the-Fly Translation**
   - Connect interim transcripts to a streaming NMT service (e.g., Transformer-based MarianMT).
   - Maintain a rolling context buffer to preserve meaning across sentence boundaries.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement segment-level translation corrections once complete sentences arrive.

4. **User Delivery**
   - Broadcast translated captions to mobile/web apps, in-room caption displays, and live stream overlays.
   - Implement local caching fallback on edge devices to handle network dropouts.
   - **Mitigation:** Provide offline caption file download after the sermon for review.

## 2. Dynamic Scripture Finder

### Objective
- Detect references to Bible verses in the sermon transcript and display full text with surrounding context in real time.

### Process Steps

1. **Transcript Monitoring & NER**
   - Continuously scan the live transcript for patterns matching scripture citations (e.g., "John 3:16").
   - Train a custom NER model on varied citation styles (e.g., "First John chapter one verse nine").
   - **Mitigation:** Combine ML with regex fallback for ambiguous or casual mentions.

2. **Scripture Retrieval**
   - Index multiple Bible translations in Elasticsearch or a similar engine for low-latency lookup.
   - Preload high-frequency book indexes in memory for sub-50 ms query performance.
   - **Mitigation:** Shard indices by translation to parallelize lookups under high load.

3. **Presentation Layer**
   - Overlay verse text in the sermon app UI, with options to pin or save passages for later study.
   - Provide a collapsible "Verse History" panel to avoid UI clutter during rapid citations.
   - **Mitigation:** Batch-display verses at natural sermon pauses or upon speaker pause.

4. **Audit & Analytics**
   - Log every detected reference with timestamp, speaker ID, and translation choice.
   - Secure logs with encryption at rest and role-based access controls.
   - **Mitigation:** Define a retention policy to purge logs in compliance with church data guidelines.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Inclusivity:** Non-native speakers and hearing-impaired attendees can follow sermons in real time.
- **Engagement:** Instant scripture display deepens understanding and fosters discussion.
- **Accessibility:** Offline downloads ensure content is available post-service.

## Implementation Strategy

| Phase         | Duration | Key Activities                                                         |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phase 1**   | 4 weeks  | Audio client build, ASR integration, latency tuning, pilot in one site. |
| **Phase 2**   | 6 weeks  | NMT setup, context buffer logic, UI streaming components.               |
| **Phase 3**   | 5 weeks  | NER training, Bible index creation, retrieval optimization.             |
| **Phase 4**   | 4 weeks  | UI/UX polish, caching fallback, history panel, integration testing.     |
| **Phase 5**   | 3 weeks  | Security review, analytics dashboard, documentation, rollout.           |

## Technical Considerations

- **ASR:** Whisper/DeepSpeech fine-tuning, GPU inference, noise suppression.
- **NMT:** Transformer models, context buffering, incremental decoding.
- **NER:** Custom tokenization, regex hybrid, training on sermon transcripts.
- **Indexing:** Elasticsearch clusters, in-memory caches, sharding by translation.
- **Streaming:** WebSocket/gRPC for audio and caption delivery, local caching.
- **Security:** TLS encryption in transit, IAM roles, RBAC for logs.

## Approach Overview
- **Iterative Delivery:** Launch translator first, gather feedback, then add scripture finder.
- **Cross‑Module Integration:** Share transcript pipeline between modules to minimize duplication.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Collaborate with church tech teams, pastors, and AV staff early.
- **Testing:** Simulate chapel acoustics, run load tests on retrieval and translation under peak usage.
